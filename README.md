# freeCodeCamp-product-landing

This project is a clone of <a href="https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/" target="_blank">product-landing-page</a> on freeCodeCamp.

I tried to replicate not using PixelPerfect, just looking at it.

From the things that I did not repeat, I can note that I could not make a sticky header for the mobile version of the site. But I don't think it's that important.
